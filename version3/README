pi-forall
=========
   A demo implementation of a simple dependently-typed language for OPLSS
   (Used in 2014 and 2013)
	Stephanie Weirich

The goal of this project is to bring up the design issues that occur in the
implementation languages like Agda, Coq, Epigram, Idris, etc. Of course, it
can't cover everything, but this code is a good starting point for discussion.

As its main purpose is didactic, the code itself has been written for
clarity, not for speed. The point of this implementation is an introduction to
practical issues of language design and how specific features interact with
each other. 

Furthermore, this code based includes a number of features (unit, booleans,
sigma types) which are all subsumed by the general mechanism for
datatypes. These are included to give examples before diving into the more
general, and much more complicated, code. 


Features
--------
  - PTS representation (uniform syntax for all levels)
  - bidirectional type checking
  - erased arguments (forall)
  - propositional equality 
  - inductive & indexed datatypes 

Not covered (Future work!)
--------------------------
  - nontermination
  - effects
  - co-induction
  - type inference & unification
  - general constraint solving

This code is open source. Feel free to extend or adapt it for your own
project. The definitive version will be uploaded to github after the summer 
school is complete.

Caveat 
------
There will be bugs. There will be *design* bugs. The language is probably not
sound. Or may not be so in the presence of 'innocent' axioms like classical
logic. Even in this little language there are many semantic pitfalls. C'est la
vie.

Installation
----------
  pi-forall requires GHC and cabal, most easily available from 
  the Haskell Platform (http://www.haskell.org/platform/) 
  
  in the top level directory type 'cabal install'
