Pi-Forall language
------------------

This language implemention is designed to accompany four lectures at
OPLSS. Notes for these lectures are available at:

- [notes.md](notes.md):    Basic language with Type:Type 
- [notes2.md](notes2.md):  Definitional and propositional equality
- [notes3.md](notes3.md):  Datatypes, with parameters and indices
- [notes4.md](notes4.md):  Erased arguments

Each set of lecture notes corresponds to an increasingly expressive demo
implementation of dependently-typed lambda calculus.

- [version1/](version1/)  
- [version2/](version2/)  
- [version3/](version3/)  
- [soln/](soln/)          

All of these versions are excerpted from the marked up files in the directory:

- [master/](master/)

All edits should be to the code in the `master` directory. The above versions
are included in the repo just for convenience.
