TODO = Summer 2022
* revise irrelevance 
* switch to unbound-generics
* update unbound-generics
* remove TemplateHaskell and pick a minimum GHC version


TODO - Summer 2014
* Switch to cayenne style, remove "inductive" types
* fix type abbreviations issue with replib  (i.e. String vs TConName and DConName)
* figure out indexed types
* remove epsilon (if possible)
* mutual blocks in definitions

DONE
* Type : Type
* recursive definitions in context
* removed Axiom
* Axiom K / UIP examples

================================================================
EXERCISE IDEAS
* write an infinite loop
* write a loop that unfolds during type checking
* write a term that should type check, but restricted unfolding prevents it

================================================================
DONE - Summer 2013
* Ind based on constrained types
* More principled annotations
* pat2term needs a type annotation
* type check pattern matching?
* Remove extra variable binding in let
* Irr arguments
   - is conv erased in Coq? Agda?
* Add preamble/credits to each file
* Add cabal file
* Many more test cases and DEBUGGING!
* check for exhaustiveness of case analysis (mostly!)

TODO
* Make the pretty-printer use precedence levels (and omit 'freshening' of vars)
* Comment/beautify source files

WON'T DO
* wildcard names
* Unification for type args - NO
* OTT file for language specification (both elaboration and type checking)

EXERCISE IDEAS
* add irrelevant arguments to data structures?
* remove positivity check, implement infinite loop?
* remove levels, implement infinite loop?
* unsoundness when escape check is removed from pattern matching ?
* add booleans?
* add sigma types?
